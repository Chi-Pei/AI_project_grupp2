            Hi and welcome to our price prediction
            application!</strong
          ><br />
          <br />

          We are three students currently studying Object Oriented Programming
          with a focus on AI at NBI Handelsakademin in Malm√∂. In this project
          we explored a dataset consisting of information about the
          housing market in Melbourne between 2016-2018. We've worked with data
          pre-processing, clustering and rendering R2 scores for different types
          of models. For our Front End we chose to implement a Google Maps
          API where you can simply click anywhere on the map to fetch
          coordinates of your desired location and make a prediction of the
          price. We've had a little over three weeks to complete this project
          and it has been a fun and educating beginner's project to
          implement an AI-algorithm resulting in a working web application.
